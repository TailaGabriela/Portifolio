# Project 1: Cyclistic bike share - https://rpubs.com/TailaGabriela/945011

This capstone project is the final project in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course. I was given the opportunity to use the skills and methods I had been taught by working on a case study project that would summarize my relevant knowledge, following the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share and act.

* The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc.
* R programming language will be used for this analysis.
